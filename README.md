# ITMD542-lab1: Introduction Landing Page

## Overview

This is my personal submission repository for Lab 1 of the course ITMD 542: Full-Stack Web Development. In this repository I created a self-introduction webpage. The page includes information about me, my academic background, my interests in web and mobile development, and my hobbies. The project demonstrates some foundational skills in HTML and CSS which includes responsive design and modern layout styling.

## Lab Goal

The goal of this first lab is to create a very simple HTML index page and CSS UI and create a Git repository and host it on GitHub and GitHub Pages.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The page is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Up-to-date HTML and CSS**: Proper use of HTML5 elements for better accessibility and structure. Custom CSS for styling, including Flexbox and Grid layouts.
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects on cards and buttons for enhanced user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout, including Flexbox and Grid.
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and hosting the project.

## Lab Requirements

• Create a new public Git repository on GitHub for this lab. Include in the repository name course number and lab (i.e. ITMD542-Lab1)
• Check the box to add a README file
• Use preferred method to interact with the Git repository and GitHub. Use a client or command line on a local copy and push commits to GitHub.
• Create an index.html file in the root of your repository. Create a webpage as the intro/landing page of your repository. This page should be an intro about the student and the class.
• Include a personal photo on the page. Add a CSS file and add CSS to this page. Any CSS frameworks are fine to use. All elements on the page styled.
• Commit files to repository and GitHub. Multiple commits should occur and pushed.
• Enable GitHub pages for main branch to serve as a website.
